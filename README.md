# PyTube Downloader

Download high resolution videos from youtube without any hassle!

## Motivation

- Due to very terrible internet connection at my hostel, any videos I want to watch have to be downloaded during university hours.
- The process is quite manual - select the video, click it, save it, check if its downloaded or err'd out.
- Me being quite an automation guy decided to get me out of the loop as much as possible and offload it to my best friend, Python.
- Lo and behold, PyTube downloader was born!

It's a mini project I did on a day or 2. Let me know your feedback on it and I will try to make it more awesome :)
